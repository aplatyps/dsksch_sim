##Disk Scheduling Simulator

A disk scheduling simulator to visualise and compare between following algorithms:
-	First Come First Serve (FCFS)
-	Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
-	Elevator (SCAN)
-	Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)
-	Up-down (LOOK)
-	Circular Up-down (C-LOOK)

The simulator will be LOOKing at the load and the average response time of each algorithm.
